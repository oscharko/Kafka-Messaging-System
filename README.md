# Kafka-Messaging-System

Nowadays, we work with multiple systems and data that runs among them. It's a common thing that one system triggers another system(s) process, or data needs to be transferred among systems. Whether your systems built on monolith or microservice, whatever database you use, you need those data moving from one point to another. And you need those movement FAST to be processed immediately (otherwise your life will be ruined).

That kind of demand is so common, and fortunately today's technology has an answer for that. Say hello to messaging system, where you can send message easily from one system to another system(s) asynchronously, in almost-real-time interval. There are some popular messaging system in the market, and in this course we will be talking about one of the most popular : Apache Kafka.
